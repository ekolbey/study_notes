## times, points and subcrossings for continuous process
## I. Nazarov & G. Decrouez 2015 -- completely rewrtitten and optimized for extensive simulations
##  X, T -- aligned value and time series of a continuous process
##  X, T = ( {X(t_i)}_{i=1}^n, {t_i}_{i=1}^n )
## X : signal to be analysed
## T : time ( mandatory )
## delta: the base scale of the crossing grid to reconstruct
## deleteFirst: if 1 then delete first crossing at each level
# 
# w: crossing duration ( cell structure, size of the number of levels )
# subx : number of subcrossings ( cell structure, size of the number of levels, first empty )
# hit_point: cell struct., hitting levels 
# hit_time: cell struct., hitting times
# Y.Shen 12.2002, O.D.Jones 7.2003, 6.2007
