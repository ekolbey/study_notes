      "#### Crossing times\n",
      "Suppose ${( t_i, x_i)}^N_{k=1}$ is a sample of some continuous process ${( X_t )}_{t\\in T}$ where $X_i = X(t_i)$.<!--, with $T\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ an inteval.-->\n",
      "\n",
      "The crossing times are defined as follows: for a given base grid spacing $\\delta>0$ and for $n,k\\geq0$ they are the stopping times $$T^n_{k+1} = \\inf\\Big\\{ t > T^n_k\\,: \\, \\big | X_t - X_{T^n_k} \\big | \\geq \\delta 2^n \\Big\\}$$ with $T^n_0 = 0$. The forcing of the zero-th xcrossing time to $0$ is done to align the grid with the process, so in effect, without losss of generality we may consider processes, which start at the origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parameter $\\delta$ is the spacing of the finest grid, with respect to which the leaves of the crossing tree are computed. Parent nodes of these leaves represent crossings of a coraser grid, namely $2\\delta$. The choice of $\\delta$ affects the tree in the following way in the case of a sampled process:\n",
      "**_THIS SECTION MUST BE DISCUSSED_**\n",
      "1. The grid with too low a value of $\\delta$ would be crossed by straight line segments between each pair consecutive sample observations. This could poison the distribution with some unfavouralbe yet unknown mixture and lead to excessive number of seemingly meaningless crossings.\n",
      "2. Too large $\\delta$ lead to a very poor and under sampled crossing tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "By construction, for a binary crossing grid, $N^l_k$, the number of subcrossings in any complete crossing between $T^l_k$ and $T^l_{k+1}$ is always an even number. This is due to the fact, that each crossing is registered as soon as two unidirectional subcrossings are encoutered, as seen by the following.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose $T^{n+1}_k$ and $T^n_m$ are aligned in that $T^{n+1}_k=T^n_m$, and $T^{n+1}_{k+1}<+\\infty$, i.e. the $n+1$ grid crossing is complete. First of all $T^n_{m+1},T^n_{m+2}\\leq T^{n+1}_{k+1}$, since otherwise the process would have crossed left the $\\pm\\delta 2^n$ band before it left the $\\pm \\delta 2^{n+1}$ band, which is twice as wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process is continuous which means that almost surely for any $\\epsilon>0$ there is $\\eta>0$ such that for any $t$ with $\\big|t-T^n_{m+1}\\big| < \\eta$ it holds that $\\big |X_{T^n_{m+1}}-X_t\\big|<\\epsilon$.\n",
      "Also for every $t\\in\\big[T^n_k, T^n_{k+1}\\big)$ it cannot be otherwise but $\\big | X_t - X_{T^n_k} \\big | < \\delta 2^n$. \n",
      "In particular, for $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta 2^n$ it means that for a small while after $T^n_{m+1}$ the process is almost surely still within the $\\pm \\delta 2^{n+1}$ band. Therefore $T^n_{m+1} < T^{n+1}_{k+1}$.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it is true that $$1\\leq \\bigg | \\frac{1}{\\delta 2^n} \\big(X_{T^n_{m+1}} - X_{T^n_m}\\big)\\bigg | < 2$$. The next crossing of $\\pm\\delta 2^n$ takes palce at $T^n_{m+2}$ and there are two possibilities:\n",
      "1. the process crossed a new $\\pm\\delta 2^{n+1}$ grid line: $\\big|X_{T^n_{m+2}} - X_{T^n_m}\\big|\\geq 2\\cdot\\delta 2^n$. In this case $T^{n+1}_{k+1}\\leq T^n_{m+2}$ and there are _two_ subcrosings.\n",
      "2. the process moved back to the level $X_{T^n_m}$, which does not incurr a crossing of $\\pm\\delta 2^{n+1}$ grid line, yet is registered by the $\\pm\\delta 2^n$ grid. In this case $T^n_{m+2} < T^{n+1}_{k+1}$ and $X_{T^n_{m+2}} = X_{T^{n+1}_{k+1}}$ -- back to the beginning of this argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the crossing is complete, $T^{n+1}_{k+1}<+\\infty$ implies that sooner that later a crossing of $\\pm\\delta 2^{n+1}$ grid occurs, in which case $T^{n+1}_{k+1}=T^n_{m+2p}$, meaning that there were exactly $2p$ subcrossings."
