When a task has been completed, write a date of completion and change the minus to a plus. Report to Geoffrey when completed.

ToDo (2014-12-01) :
-	1. Read and summarize the following papers :
-		• A non-parametric test for self-similarity and stationarity in network traffic, 2005 [Jones, Shen]
-		• Estimating the Hurst index of a self-similar process via the crossing tree, 2004 [Jones, Shen]
-		• Estimation of the multifractal spectrum using the crossing tree, 2013 [Decrouez, Amblard, Jones]

ToDo (2014-12-20) :
-	1. Study the matlab code provided by Geoffrey
-	2. Enhance knowledge in SSSI processes
-	3. Study thorem 1 in Jones, Rolls (2011)
-	4. Papers to read and summarize :
-		• A characterization of, and hypothesis test for, continuous local martingales, 2011 [Jones, Rolls]
-		• Introduction to Multifractals, 1999 [Reidi]
-		• MSU 2014 -- On the uses of the crossing tree for the construction and analysis of multifracta processes, 2014 [DeCrouez et al.]

ToDo
	- Check: conjectures about the offspring distribution and its relation to the Hurst exponent. Do simulations for the HSSSI (Hermite and Weierstrass processes):
	--  Check the independence assumptions
	--	P(z=2i) is geometric with p = 2^(1-1/H)
	--	P(du|+) = P(ud|-) = 1/sqrt(\mu)


Letar:
	- Orginal Owen's: redo the testing in the paper the using bootstrap statistics for one signal. Build trees using shifted lattices.

	- Pool all the Zs and check whether or not their distribution equals the conjectured
