Graph $G=(V,E)$. The set $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is a subset of $V\times V$.
An element $(u,v)\in E$ is an edge starting at $u$ and ending in $v$.
The incidence matrix is defined as $a_{ij}=1_E\brac{(i,j)}$, so it denotes and edge $i\to j$.

Random graphs are pure mathematics theory created by Erd\"os and Renyui.
Statistical physics for analysis of complex networks.

Network, social network, complex network just another name for a graph.

Power law (scale free) few vertices with high degree, many nodes with few neighbours.

Complex means that reduction of a system actually destroys the systems.
Cannot predict the whole by the studying the parts.

Facebook network -- many worlds network -- typical for a power law random graph.

Complex networks usually have the following characteristics: \begin{enumerate}
	\item Power law distribution of the vertex degree;
	\item Small diameter and average path length;
	\item High propensity to cluster: the number of triangles in the network.
\end{enumerate}

Let's introduce the following local features of the graph: the vertex degree.
\begin{align*}
	\delta^+(v) &\defn \#\obj{\induc{u\in V}\, (u,v)\in E }\\
	\delta^-(v) &\defn \#\obj{\induc{u\in V}\, (v,u)\in E }
\end{align*}

``Any two people are on average separated no more than by six intermediate connections.''

\item ``An experimental study of the small-world problem'', Travers j., Milgram S., 1969
\end{item}

Bethe lattice $(V,E)$ is an infinite cycle-free graph with every node having the same number of neighbours $z > 1$.
Given an edge $(v,u)\in E$ the end vertex $u$ is connected to $z-1$ other neighbours, which means that $N_k = N_{k-1}\cdot (z-1)$ with $N_1 = z$, since the centre vertex is connected to $z$ other vertices.
Thus $N_k = z \brac{z-1}^{k-1}$.
And the total number of nodes is \[S_n \defn 1+\sum_{k = 1}^n N_k = 1 + z \frac{\brac{z-1}^n-1}{(z-1)-1}\] (check this!)

For any network $G=(V,E)$ its \textbf{order} is $\abs{V}$ and size is $\abs{E}$.

% As for the format of homework, python + \Latex is acceptable.
